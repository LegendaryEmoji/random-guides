### How to get the source code of a repository?

There are many ways to get the source code of a repository, this guide shows three of those methods.

### Git

- [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

"Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows." - Wikipedia  
(In the bash, bash is something that you get after installing the Git)
```
git clone <URL>
```
`<URL>`: String - Your github repository URL  
That's it, you have a folder that has the name of repository and the whole code!

### Normal zip

Github also supports downloading whole project using zip files. To Download, just go to home page of the repository e.g. [random-guides home](https://github.com/LegendaryEmoji/random-guides) & you will see `Code` button, click on it and you will see the option to download the zip file.
You have to use some kind of extractor to extract files from `.zip` files, you can either use your default operating system extractor or third-party softwares.

### Default clone

If you are using websites like [REPLIT](https://replit.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), etc. They supports repository cloning by default.
For example, for repl, when creating an REPL, just click on `Import from Github` then you can copy and paste the URL of the repository and there you go.
